# AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant** automates the process of code review by integrating **ESLint** for static analysis and **OpenAI** for intelligent, context-aware feedback. The tool provides real-time code reviews on GitHub pull requests, improving code quality by detecting errors, enforcing coding standards, and suggesting improvements. This project aims to enhance collaboration, reduce errors, and foster adherence to best practices within development teams.

## Features

- **Real-Time Code Reviews**: Automatically triggers on pull requests to the main branch.
- **Static Analysis**: Uses **ESLint** to detect common JavaScript issues such as syntax errors, style violations, and unused variables.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4** for in-depth, intelligent suggestions and code improvements, including performance optimizations, bug prevention, and best practices.
- **GitHub Integration**: Comments directly on pull requests with detailed feedback, linking to resources and offering actionable tips.

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the code review process.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: Provides AI-driven feedback and suggestions for code improvements.
- **ESLint**: Ensures the code follows industry-standard best practices.
